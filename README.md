# Azul Board Game Implementation
*This project was completed as part of the Advanced Programming Techniques course in Semester 1, 2020.*

The project required groups of 3 to implement the board game [Azul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukn_UDfoODI&t=313s) as a console game in the C++ programming language. We were then required to extend this implementation individually with enhancements of our own choosing; I chose to make UI upgrades and include a single player mode in which you play against the computer, which searches the board for an objectively good move.

## Running the Game
* Ensure you are capable of compiling and running C++ programs in either WSL or a UNIX terminal
* from the root directory...
```
$ make azul
$ ./azul
```
* ...and then follow the in-game instructions
